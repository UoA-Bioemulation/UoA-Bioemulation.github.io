    The use of simulation models in biology is extensively studied.
    In contrast to simulation, emulation is the process of designing and validating a controller, such as a pacemaker, in closed-loop with a physical process, or so called plant, such as a live heart, which needs controlling.
    Emulation may be carried out either during the clinical trial phase with human subjects or animals.
    We argue that such emulation is expensive, time limiting, and has associated ethical considerations.
    We propose the science of <em>remulation</em> (reverse-emulation) as an alternative to emulation.
    Remulation entails building executable models of the plant, rather than the controller, which respond in <em>real-time</em> to adjoining controllers allowing for flexible, cheaper, and quick closed-loop validation of controllers.
    <em>Remulation</em> of a biological organ, rather than a physical process, is termed <em>bio-remulation</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The executable biological models developed by the science of bio-remulation allows us to realize organs on reconfigurable computer chips, called <em>Field Programmable Gate Array</em> (FPGA).
    Such an engineered "Executable Organ on Chip" (ExOoC) provides high-fidelity and real-time capabilities like a real biological organ (e.g., the heart), from the point of view of the medical device (e.g., the pacemaker).
    Bio-remulation of such ExOoCs not only has excellent potential for medical device validation and certification but also can be used for personalisation and non-invasive diagnostics.
    We have developed the first high-fidelity remulation model of the cardiac conduction system and engineered an <em>Executable Heart on Chip</em>.
    This heart on a chip has been used to validate functional correctness and timing properties of off-the-shelf pacemakers.

<h3 class="padding-top-sm">Comparison with Biofluidic Organ-on-Chip (BfOoC)</h3>
<p>
    A BfOoC is a biofluidic chip with living cells that are capable of recreating organ level physiology.
    Such BfOoC are being developed to simplify the clinical trial phase of drugs.
    The following table presents a qualitative comparison between BfOoC and ExOoC.

<p>
    Like drugs, implantable medical devices also need clinical trials.
    During these clinical trials, the device is exhaustively validated using animal or human subjects.
    However, such trials are expensive, time consuming and have strict ethical considerations with associated hazards to human or animal life similar to drug testing.
    Consider, for example, pacemakers; a pacemaker is a device that is designed to treat bradycardia (a slow heart rhythm) by sensing the heart function and providing therapy when needed.
    A pacemaker senses the electrical activity of the heart through leads placed inside the heart and actuates through the same leads by stimulating the heart with electrical impulses when needed.
    In spite of the rigorous development cycle, clinical trials and certification process of pacemakers, several devices have been recalled due to software failures.
</p>
<p>
    BfOoC is suitable for testing of drugs, but is not ideal for the validation of implantable devices.
    There are several reasons for this.
    Firstly, a device validation framework will involve the closed-loop interaction of the device under test (the pacemaker) with its adjoining organ (the heart).
    A pacemaker senses Electrograms (EGMs), which are produced due to the propagation of cellular action potentials traveling through the cardiac conduction system starting from the Sinoatrial (SA) node -- the natural pacemaker of the heart.
    A complete or substantial conduction system of the heart is necessary to produce accurate EGMs.
    BfOoC are nascent technological innovations, which make them incapable of simulating complete heart behaviour.
    We observe, however, attempts have been made to create biofluidic heart on a chip, which enables recordings from cardiac myocytes and also study the impact of drugs.
    However, these chips are limited when required to create the full heart behaviour as needed by a pacemaker.
</p>
<p>
    Validating timing properties of a pacemaker requires the heart model to respond in real-time to the pacemaker inputs.
    Furthermore, varying timing behaviours, such as increased heart rate, reduced heart rhythm need to be induced into the heart model to test the response of the pacemaker.
    A BfOoC is not proposed for such closed-loop interaction with devices and may not be able to provide such real-time response at the entire organ level.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, validation entails studying the response of the pacemaker in closed-loop with a heart induced with different diseased states, such a cardiac tissue scars, failure of the Atrio-Ventricular (AV) node, etc, or even a combination of multiple diseases.
    Hence, quick reconfigurability of the heart model is necessary.
    BfOoC are not designed for such reconfigurability and personalization.
